# GOATFinder
Not goat as in the animal that eats tin cans. GOAT as in Greatest Of All Time. 
The purpose of this app is to figure out, using various weights and measures, who the greatest baseball players of all time are, and the take it a step further and answer the question: who are the greatest baseball players of <i>any</i> given time period?

The data was sourced from Sean Lahman's <a href="http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/">baseball database</a>, and extends to 2016.

Inital MVP: Create a slider that queries for a user-given year window and returns a roster of the greatest baseball players by their primary position through various criteria: batting stats (On Base Plus Slugging) for position players, Wins then ERA/WHIP for starting pitchers, and Saves then ERA/WHIP for bullpen pitchers.

Stretch goals: 
<ul>
  <li>Allow for user-defined weighting of various other stats, such as homeruns, strikeouts, etc.</li>
  <li>Allow for querying by a given team/division/year</li>
  <li>Refactor in React to allow for dynamic searching</li>
</ul>
